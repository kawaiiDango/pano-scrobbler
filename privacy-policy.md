### Introduction

kawaiiDango built the Pano Scrobbler app as a Free and Open Source app licensed under GPLv3 or
later. This app is provided by kawaiiDango at no cost and is intended for use as is, without any
warranty or fitness for a particular purpose. One may freely obtain its complete source code at:
[github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler)

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to
this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this
Privacy Policy.

### Personal Information Collected

User identifiable information such as a username or API token is used for logging in to music
tracking services of your choice such as Last.fm, Libre.fm, ListenBrainz and self-hosted instances.

### Non-Personal Information Collected

- The app sends non-personal information such as titles of music playing on the device and other
  music metadata, to the previously mentioned music tracking services of your choice, for its core
  functionality.
- To fetch images of artists and albums, the name of the artist and album is sent to Spotify. This
  is functionality disabled by default for fresh installations.
- To fetch the missing metadata while scrobbling Deezer on Windows, the app uses the Deezer API.
- If you are using the Google Play version and automatic error reporting is enabled, an anonymous,
  resettable device identifier is sent to Firebase Crashlytics, along with stack traces of the
  error.
- If you are using the non-Google Play version and have entered the unlock key, a truncated hash of
  a device identifier as well as the unlock key is sent to my backend server to check its validity
  and to limit the number of devices it can be used on. Since hashing is a one-way function, the
  real identifier cannot be recovered from the hash.

### Third Party Services

The app uses third party services for its core functionality and analytics that may already have
information used to identify you.

### Log Data

If automatic error reporting is enabled (for the Google Play version only) and an error occurs in
my app or if you choose to send logs for a bug report via email, non-personal information such as
logs for events that led to the error, stack traces for the error, device information such as model
name, manufacturer name, OS name and version, amount of RAM used etc. are collected and sent to me
through third party services namely Firebase Crashlytics or your email provider. This information is
used to identify and fix bugs.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
device's internal memory.

This app uses a webview for logging in to Last.fm. This 3rd party website may use cookies to keep
track of logged-in sessions and to improve their services.

### Notification Read, Reply and Control (Android Permission)

The permission is used to read music metadata and playing state from other apps using the
MediaSessionManager API. The app does not access or parse actual notification texts except from
these apps, if they have been enabled for scrobbling by the user:

- Pixel's Now Playing
- Ambient Music Mod
- Shazam
- Audile

### Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no
responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Children’s Privacy

This app is intended for a general audience. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
contact information from children under 13. Please refer to our third
party [Last.fm's children's privacy policy](https://privacy.paramount.com/en/childrens).
