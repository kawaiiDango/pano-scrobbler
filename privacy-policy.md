# Pano Scrobbler Privacy Policy

_Last updated on 2023, Aug 30 UTC_


kawaiiDango built the Pano Scrobbler app as an Open Source, Freemium app. This app is provided by kawaiiDango at no cost and is intended for use as is. One may obtain its source code here: [github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler)

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

### Information collected

- Personal Information

User identifiable information such as a username or API token is used for logging in to music tracking services of your choice such as Last.fm, Libre.fm, GnuFM, ListenBrainz etc.

- Non-Personal Information

The app sends non-personal information such as titles of music playing on the device and other music metadata, to the previously mentioned music tracking service of your choice. If you use the "Scrobble from mic" feature, a fingerprint of audio sample from the microphone will be sent to ACRCloud for identification of the song. To fetch images of artists, the name of the artist is sent to Spotify. If automatic error reporting is enabled, an anonymous, resettable device identifier is sent to Firebase Crashlytics.

### Third Party Services

The app uses third party services for its core functionality and analytics that may already have information used to identify you.
