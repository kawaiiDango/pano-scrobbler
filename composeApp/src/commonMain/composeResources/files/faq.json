[{"platform":"android","question":"The app skips scrobbles when it is in the background / The app says that it has been killed","answer":"Some manufacturers such as Xiaomi, Huawei, OnePlus and others do not allow 3rd party apps to run in the background by default. Check dontkillmyapp.com and follow all the steps in there, for your device. The non-Play version of this app can optionally display a persistent notification at all times, which may help. It may be impossible to use this app on a stock ROM from certain manufacturers, due to the said restrictions.","entities":[{"type":"link","start":133,"end":150,"url":"https://dontkillmyapp.com"}]},{"platform":"android","question":"The app says that scrobbling is disabled","answer":"Check if Pano Scrobbler has the permission to read notifications from other apps. Go to Settings > Apps > Special app access > Notification read, reply and control > Pano Scrobbler. The exact location and name of the setting will depend on your Android version and manufacturer. Note that this is different from the standard \"notifications\" permission, which has nothing to do with reading notifications from other apps."},{"question":"All of my scrobbles from Spotify are duplicated","answer":"This happens if you have more than one scrobbler connected/running. Disable or uninstall other scrobblers. Disconnect your Spotify account from the last.fm website."},{"question":"How do I scrobble only the first artist instead of all the performers?","answer":"Go to Configure > Use the first artist only"},{"question":"The app is scrobbling non music videos from YouTube","answer":"Unfortunately there is no way to detect whether a video is a music video, from just the video title and the channel name, reported to the OS media controls. You may block certain channels from scrobbling or turn off YouTube scrobbling entirely, from settings."},{"question":"I cannot edit scrobbles older than 14 days","answer":"It is not possible to edit scrobbles older than 14 days using this app, regardless of whether you have a last.fm pro subscription, due to the method used for editing."},{"question":"Pictures of some artists are missing even though they have a picture on last.fm","answer":"Artist pictures are sourced from Spotify because the last.fm API does not provide them. Due to the implementation, the artist's name must have an exact match on Spotify. Sometimes, language differences between the name on last.fm vs Spotify cause this issue.  As a workaround, you can enable \"Approximate search for artist images\". Note that this might give you wrong images for some artists. You can also choose your own mapping to Spotify pictures or choose your own from gallery."},{"question":"Pictures of some tracks are missing in the charts screen","answer":"Tracks do not have images for themselves. They have album arts depending on the album or single they are associated with. The last.fm API may not provide an album name for some tracks. In that case, no image will be displayed."},{"question":"Certain tracks are being ignored","answer":"Last.FM has a spam filter, which filters out tracks/albums/artists with titles similar to \"Unknown\", \".mp3\", \"Track_01\" etc"},{"question":"The scrobbler submits incomplete data / does not submit album artists","answer":"This can happen if your music player does not provide the complete metadata in its MediaSession on Android, SystemMediaTransportControls on Windows or MPRIS on Linux.  Use a different music player, which does that.","entities":[{"type":"code","start":83,"end":95},{"type":"code","start":108,"end":136},{"type":"code","start":151,"end":156}]},{"question":"What is the maximum number of edits that can be saved?","answer":"There is no limit for regular edits and blocks. However, there can be at most 50 active or enabled regex rules for performance reasons, because it has to try out every regex rule for every scrobble."},{"question":"How do I stream music on this app?","answer":"This is not a music streaming app. However, you can click the search and play button, to search and play the selected song on your favourite music player."},{"platform":"android","question":"The search and play button always opens a particular music player","answer":"This can happen if you have set that particular music player as the default. To fix this, go to that music player's app info and tap on \"Clear defaults\"."},{"platform":"android","question":"Where is the scrobble from mic feature?","answer":"In-app scrobble from mic has been removed, in favor of scrobbling from Shazam/AutoShazam, Audile, Pixel's Now Playing or Ambient Music Mod."},{"platform":"android","question":"Where are the Tasker intents?","answer":"Tasker intents have been replaced with ContentProvider query URIs and an allowlist, which are more secure."},{"platform":"desktop","question":"How do I launch the app as minimized to tray?","answer":"Use the --minimized or -m command line argument.","entities":[{"type":"code","start":8,"end":19},{"type":"code","start":23,"end":25}]},{"platform":"desktop","question":"How do I store the app's data in a different location?","answer":"Use the --data-dir or -d command line argument, followed by the path to the directory.","entities":[{"type":"code","start":8,"end":18},{"type":"code","start":22,"end":24}]},{"platform":"desktop","question":"How do I correctly scrobble media playing on a web browser?","answer":"Browsers on Windows do not report the complete song metadata to the OS media controls. The situation is better on Linux, but depends on the website correctly reporting the metadata in their MediaSession. The same applies to browser-like apps (e.g. most Electron and WebView apps). Use WebScrobbler for web browsers, instead."},{"platform":"desktop","question":"The app does not show notifications on Windows","answer":"To show notifications on Windows, the app's ID must be registered with the OS and linked to its start menu shortcut. This is done by the installer in install mode. So, it won't work if you are using it portable mode or have removed the start menu shortcut."},{"question":"How do I get a refund for a 'Support this app' payment?","answer":"For Google Play purchases, you can request a refund within a 48-hour window, from the Google Play website. For voluntary donations of arbritrary amounts made through Ko-Fi or BuyMeACoffee, there are no refunds, as these are donations for supporting the development of this free and open source project, and not purchases.","entities":[{"type":"link","start":86,"end":105,"url":"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/15574897"}]}]
