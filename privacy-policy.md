# Privacy Policy

_Last updated on 2025, June 21 UTC_

Applicable to the Pano Scrobbler app version 4.0 and later.

kawaiiDango built the Pano Scrobbler app as an Open Source, Freemium app. This app is provided by
kawaiiDango at no cost and is intended for use as is. One may obtain its source code
here: [github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler](https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler)

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to
this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this
Privacy Policy.

### Information collected

- Personal Information

User identifiable information such as a username or API token is used for logging in to music
tracking services of your choice such as Last.fm, Libre.fm, ListenBrainz and self-hosted instances.

- Non-Personal Information

The app sends non-personal information such as titles of music playing on the device and other music
metadata, to the previously mentioned music tracking services of your choice. To fetch images of
artists, the name of the artist is sent to Spotify. If you are using the version downloaded from
Google Play and automatic error reporting is enabled, an anonymous, resettable device identifier is
sent to Firebase Crashlytics. If you are using the non-Google Play version and have entered the
unlock key, a truncated hash of a device identifier as well as the unlock key is sent to the backend
server to check its validity and to limit the number of devices it can be used on.

### Third Party Services

The app uses third party services for its core functionality and analytics that may already have
information used to identify you.

### Log Data

If automatic error reporting is enabled (for the Google Play version only) and an error occurs in
my app or if you choose to send logs for a bug report via email, non-personal information such as
logs for events that led to the error, stack traces for the error, device information such as model
name, manufacturer name, OS name and version, amount of RAM used etc are collected and sent to me
through third party services. This information is used to identify and fix bugs.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your
device's internal memory.

This app uses a webview for logging in to services such as Last.fm, Libre.fm or custom servers with
a URL of your choice. These 3rd party websites may use cookies to keep track of logged in sessions
and to improve their services.

### Notification Access Permission

The permission is used to read music metadata and playing state from other apps. The app does not
access or read actual notifications except: a) Pixel's Now Playing, if you have a Pixel device and
Pixel Now Playing scrobbling is enabled. b) Songs recognized in AutoShazam mode by the Shazam app,
if it is enabled for scrobbling.

### Links to Other Sites

This app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise
you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no
responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Childrenâ€™s Privacy

This app is intended for a general audience. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
contact information from children under 13. Please refer to our third
party [Last.fm's children's privacy policy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/childrens-privacy-policy).

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
