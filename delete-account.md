# Delete Your Scrobbling Account(s)

Pano Scrobbler is a third party client app, which uses the APIs of multiple scrobbling services, such as last.fm, libre.fm, listenbrainz.org, and self-hosted custom servers. Pano Scrobbler does not host your accounts and does not have direct access to your data.

However, you can use the following links to delete your account(s), depending on the server where your account is hosted:

- For last.fm: [last.fm/settings/account/delete](https://www.last.fm/settings/account/delete)

- For libre.fm: [libre.fm/user-delete.php](https://libre.fm/user-delete.php)

- For listenbrainz.org: [listenbrainz.org/profile/delete](https://listenbrainz.org/profile/delete)

For self-hosted custom servers such as GNU FM, Custom Listenbrainz, Maloja and Pleroma, check their respective documentations.
